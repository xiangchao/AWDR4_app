= The Depot Online Store

 

This application implements an online store, with a catalog, cart, and orders.

 

It is divided into two main sections:

 

* The buyer's side of the application manages the catalog, cart, 

  and checkout. It is implementation spans in four models and associated

  controllers and views: Cart, LineItem, Order, and Product.  Additionally,

  there is a StoreController for the store front itself, and a

  SessionsController to manage sessions.

 

* Only administrators can access stuff in the seller's side

  (product maintenance and order fulfillment).  This is implemented by the

  LoginController, is enforced by the ApplicationController#authorize

  method, and assisted by the Users and Carts resources.

 

This code was produced as an example for the book {Agile Web Development with

Rails}[http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4th-edition]. It should not be 

run as a real online store.
